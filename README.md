# jobscheduler
Restful service that launches a Docker-based job in an AWS EC2 Spot Instance and automatically terminate it when the job is finished.

# Solution Design

Jobscheduler has 2 mains components which are AWS lambda functions.

1. eventReceiver: This function is called periodically to inspect the job's datasource and take the appropriate action in accordance with job's status:

   - Scheduled: if a job is scheduled with a earlier timestamp in face of the current time the function will launch a spot instance request for that job and update the job status to Requested.
   - Requested: check the spot instance request. If has a pending status just wait, if is canceled, launch the request again, if it is fullfiled update the job with the instanceId.
   - FinishedOK or FinishedNOK: terminates the ec2 instance for the job.
   - TerminatedOK or Terminated: nothing, job's done.

For the proof of concept and to check the results faster, I usually call this function with one minuto interval, but this could and should be tunned.   

2. jobRESTService: This function implements the API and it has 4 operations:
	
   - schedule:  Given a Docker image, the desired date-time and a list of ENV Variables, schedule the provisioning of a docker container for that image at the time.
   - list: list the scheduled jobs
   - status: show the status for one job
   - callback: to be called by the scheduled application when it finishes processing	
  
The solution uses AWS DynamoDB as a datasource with a Table called Jobs. For examples on data format, please check "input" folder. Note that same JSONs are also used in API body requests.
